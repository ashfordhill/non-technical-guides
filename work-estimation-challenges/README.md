# Work Estimation Challenges

How come work estimation for software development is so difficult? 

Let's try to explain the problem in non-technical terms.

## Mythical Man-Month

The "Man-Month" Myth: A "man-month" is a deceptive unit of measure, as men and months are not interchangeable; tasks requiring communication cannot be perfectly divided.

In other words, you can't produce a baby in 1 month even if you were trying to utilize 9 women at once.

### IKEA Furniture

Imagine building an IKEA dresser:

A dresser is a good example of a piece of furniture that can be assembled by 2 people in parallel. 

Now imagine trying to split the work for building an IKEA bookshelf:

Working in parallel doesn't work very well here; the shelves don't need much assembly and they can't be added until the frame is done. Sure, *some* work could probably be divided but it doesn't pan out as nicely as the dresser.
